#### SEED-DISPERSAL-DISRUPTIONS ####
Review of studies on biotic and abiotic seed dispersal disruptions (SDD) to ascertain the global change drivers addressed, dispersal modes impacted, plant processes affected, and spatial focus of existing research on this topic up-to-date.

Here we provide the generated dataset for the review paper:

"Drivers of ecological and evolutionary disruptions in the seed dispersal process: research trends and biases" by Donoso I., Fricke E.C., Herv√≠as-Parejo S., Rogers H.S, Traveset A. 

This manuscript is currently under review in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. Research topic: Animal Seed Dispersal: An Ecosystem Service in Crisis

"Disruptions_dataset.xlsx" is based on published literature and contains:

* a first worksheet tab specifying:
1) study ID
2) YEAR of publication
3) REALM under study 
4) whether SDD occurred on mainland or an ISLAND, and if so, the type of island (i.e., continental vs. oceanic)
5) ECOSYSTEM under study
6) type of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic DRIVERS of SDD
7) seed DISPERSER under study
8) in the case of ABIOTIC dispersal, the main seed dispersal vector
9) RESPONSE VARIABLES that were assessed in each publication
10) if the study considered SDD at a species- or at community- LEVEL
11) whether the main results were based on empirical data, simulations, or the combination of these two APPROACHES

* a second worksheet tab with the full list of references addressed in this review paper
